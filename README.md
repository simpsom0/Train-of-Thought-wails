# Train of Thought
Simple desktop application for speech to text recording (for my grandfather).

## Setup
- This is the wails backend module. To run the entire app with wails make sure to replace the frontend folder with the frontend repo located [here](https://github.com/simpsom0/Train-of-Thought-frontend) (MAKE SURE TO KEEP THE `wailsjs` FOLDER).
- Run `npm install` in the frontend folder
- Run `wails dev` in the train_of_thought folder
